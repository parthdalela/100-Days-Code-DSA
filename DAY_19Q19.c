/*Problem: Given an array of integers, find two elements whose sum is closest to zero.

Input:
- First line: integer n
- Second line: n space-separated integers

Output:
- Print the pair of elements whose sum is closest to zero

Example:
Input:
5
1 60 -10 70 -80

Output:
-10 1

Explanation: Among all possible pairs, the sum of -10 and 1 is -9, which is the closest to zero compared to other pairs.*/
