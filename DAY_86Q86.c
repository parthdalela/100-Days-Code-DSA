/*Problem: Given a sorted array of integers and a target value x, implement the Lower Bound and Upper Bound operations using Binary Search.

Lower Bound: The index of the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to x.
Upper Bound: The index of the first element in the array that is strictly greater than x.

Input:
- First line: integer n representing the size of the array
- Second line: n space-separated sorted integers
- Third line: integer x (the target value)

Output:
- Print two integers:
  1) Index of the lower bound of x
  2) Index of the upper bound of x

Example:
Input:
7
1 2 4 4 4 5 7
4

Output:
2 5

Explanation:
For the given array [1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7] and x = 4:
- The lower bound is at index 2, which is the first occurrence of 4.
- The upper bound is at index 5, which is the first element greater than 4 (i.e., 5).
Binary Search is used to find both bounds efficiently in O(log n) time.*/
